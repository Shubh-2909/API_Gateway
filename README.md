FRONTEND - MIIDLE END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and the microservices.
- Using this middle end , when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actually respond to this request.
- we can do message validation , response transformation , rate limiting.
- we try to prepare an API gateway that acts as the middle end.
- An API gateway is a data-plane entry point for API calls. It acts as a "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from backend services.
